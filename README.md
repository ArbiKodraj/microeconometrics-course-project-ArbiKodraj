# Replication of Philip Oreopoulos (2011)

---


This notebook contains my replication of the results from the following paper:

> <font face="ITC Berkeley Oldstyle" size="4"> [Philip Oreopoulos (2011)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.3.4.148). "Why Do Skilled Immigrants Struggle in the Labor Market? A Field Experiment with Thirteen Thousand Resumes." American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 3, 148â€“171.</font><br />


Oreopoulos (2011) sent thousands of randomly manipulated resumes to employers who advertised open positions in Toronto. His aim was to find out why highly qualified immigrants have problems asserting themselves in the Canadian labor market. The study found significant discrimination in a variety of occupations against applicants with foreign working experience or applicants with Indian, Pakistani, Chinese and Greek names compared to English names. Listing additional competences such as fluency in languages, experience in multinational companies, training in very selective schools or extracurricular activities appear not to have offsetting effects. Recruiters justify this behavior with concerns about language skills, but were not able to adress compensatory skills.

## Reproducibility:

In order to ensure full reproducibility, I have set up a continous integration environment using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) which can be checked here: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ArbiKodraj/microeconometrics-course-project-ArbiKodraj.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ArbiKodraj/microeconometrics-course-project-ArbiKodraj)
