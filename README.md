# Replication of Philip Oreopoulos (2011)

---


This notebook contains my replication of the results from the following paper:

> <font face="ITC Berkeley Oldstyle" size="4">Philip Oreopoulos 2011. "Why Do Skilled Immigrants Struggle in the Labor Market? A Field Experiment with Thirteen Thousand Resumes." American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 3, 148â€“171.</font><br />



<i><b>  Downloading and viewing this notebook: </b> </i> 

- The best way to view this notebook is by downloading it and the repository it is located in from GitHub. Other viewing options like MyBinder or NBViewer may have issues with displaying images or coloring of certain parts (missing images can be viewed in the folder files on GitHub).

- The original paper, as well as the data and code provided by the authors can be accessed [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.3.4.148 "American Economic Association").

<i><b> Information about replication and individual contributions: </i></b>

- For the replication, I try to remain true to the original structure of the paper so readers can easily follow along and compare. All tables and figures are named and labeled as they appear in Oreopoulos. (2011).


- The tables in my replication appear transposed compared to the original tables to suit my workflow in Python.


- For transparency, all sections in the replication that constitute independent contributions by me and are not part of results presented (or include deviations from the methods used) in the paper are marked as extensions.
